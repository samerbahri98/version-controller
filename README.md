# Version Contoller

## Abstract

The aim of this project is to create a a private version control tool using git technology. This tool is very similar to Github with the key difference that unlike Github (hosted in the cloud), the user (admin) is expected to provide hosting by himself through baremetal or hosting providers. The tool is expected to have a git service, some business logic with nodejs, a database with postgresql and a front-end web app with React. These services will be created with docker, and orchistrated together with docker-compose.
